## 😄 Who am I? 

My name is Sidd Mittal and I'm a Systems Design Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. Through my past internships, I've garnered a passion for both product and backend development. From concept to release, I really enjoy going through the design and development process to create a product that will truly make someone's life easier. I crave impact in everything I do and I always love a good challenge :) 

## 🔭 What am I currently working on/learning? 

I'm currently working on gaining my certificate as a AWS Certified Cloud Practioner. As someone interested in designing the infrastructure and backend of applications, I believe it is extremely important to understand cloud computing as it is becoming so widely used in the industry. 

## 💻 Past Internships

### 🐕 [Zynga](https://www.zynga.com)

Had a ton of fun diving into the data world at Zynga with the data ingestion team. I got to roll up my sleeves and design a heartbeat injector microservice, which became our trusty watchdog for monitoring pipeline flow. We successfully extracted attributes relating to latency and throughput, with a learning spree on AWS Kinesis, Lambda, Datadog, and Terraform. Go became a new language I could converse in, all while learning from some of the sharpest and most talented engineers I’ve ever met.

### 🧪 [WSIB Innovation Lab](https://www.wsib-lab.ca)

Worked on the end-to-end development of Ontario's first mobile app that allows workers to submit an injury claim. This was a really rewarding experience as my team and I took complete control over every aspect of this project – from choosing the tech stack, to planning architecture diagrams/design patterns, developing features, and releasing the first MVP.  

### 🏎 [Genesys](https://www.genesys.com/genesys-cloud)

Learned a ton about microservice architecture, AWS tools and testing infrastructure. I was also able to learn from some incredibly knowledgeable mentors about industry-standard coding, and I really appreciated how supportive and friendly everyone in the company was. 

### 🛠 [Bidmii International](https://bidmii.com)

Worked with a tight-knit team of 6 developers to develop an online marketplace for homeowners. This was my first internship, and right from the start, I was thrown in the deep-end of React and Java code. I learned a lot about the semantics of front-end development and scoping out projects from planning to production.
